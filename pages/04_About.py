# Project history
st.header("Project History")
st.write("""
The PDB Analysis Platform began as an internal tool at our research laboratory to streamline the 
analysis of protein structures. Recognizing its potential to benefit the wider scientific community, 
we developed it into a comprehensive web application with funding from the National Science Foundation.

The platform has evolved significantly since its inception in 2020:

- **2020**: Initial development of core analysis algorithms
- **2021**: Beta release with basic functionality for structure analysis
- **2022**: Added comparative analysis features and improved user interface
- **2023**: Launched enterprise version with enhanced security and collaborative features

Today, our platform is used by researchers at universities, pharmaceutical companies, and biotech 
startups worldwide.
