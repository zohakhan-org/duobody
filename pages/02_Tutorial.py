Welcome to the PDB Analysis Platform tutorial. This guide will help you understand how to use 
our platform effectively to analyze and compare protein structures using PDB files.

# Tutorial sections

st.subheader("What are PDB Files?")
st.write("""
PDB (Protein Data Bank) files contain atomic coordinate data for biological macromolecules like proteins and nucleic acids. 
These files store information about the 3D structure of molecules, including:

- Atomic coordinates
- Chemical bonds
- Secondary structure assignments
- Experimental details

PDB files typically have a `.pdb` extension and follow a standardized format established by the Worldwide Protein Data Bank.
""")

st.subheader("Where to Find PDB Files")
st.write("""
You can obtain PDB files from several sources:

1. **RCSB Protein Data Bank** (https://www.rcsb.org/) - The primary repository for protein structures
2. **PDBe** (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/) - European resource for collection, organization, and dissemination of PDB data
3. **PDBj** (https://pdbj.org/) - Japanese resource for PDB data
4. **AlphaFold DB** (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/) - For AI-predicted protein structures

Simply search for proteins of interest and download the PDB files for analysis on our platform.

# Analysis tutorial
st.header("2. Single PDB File Analysis")
st.write("""
To analyze a single PDB file:

1. Navigate to the **Analysis** page from the sidebar
2. Click on the file upload area or drag and drop your PDB file
3. Ensure your file has a `.pdb` extension
4. Click the "Analyze" button
5. View the generated report with structural information

The analysis provides details about:
- Number of models, chains, residues, and atoms
- Chain composition
- Residue types
- Bond statistics
""")

# Compare tutorial
st.header("3. Comparing Two PDB Files")
st.write("""
To compare two PDB structures:

1. Navigate to the **Analysis** page
2. Upload two PDB files using the provided upload areas
3. Click the "Compare Structures" button
4. Review the comparison report highlighting the differences between the structures

This feature is particularly useful for:
- Comparing wild-type and mutant proteins
- Analyzing conformational changes
- Studying ligand binding effects
- Evaluating experimental vs. predicted structures
""")

# Interpreting results
st.header("4. Interpreting Results")
st.write("""
Our analysis reports provide several key metrics:

- **Basic Statistics**: Chain, residue, and atom counts
- **Chain Analysis**: Composition of each chain in the structure
- **Residue Analysis**: Distribution of amino acid types
- **Structural Features**: Secondary structure elements, bond lengths

When comparing structures, pay special attention to:
- Differences in residue and atom counts
- Unique residues or chains in each structure
- RMSD values between corresponding atoms (when available)
- Significant changes in bond lengths or angles
""")

# Tips and best practices
st.header("5. Tips and Best Practices")
st.write("""
- **Clean Your PDB Files**: Remove heteroatoms, water molecules, or alternative conformations if they're not relevant to your analysis
- **Consistent Comparison**: When comparing structures, ensure they represent the same protein or region
- **File Size Limit**: Files should be under 10MB for optimal performance
- **Troubleshooting**: If you encounter errors, check your PDB file format and ensure it follows standard conventions
