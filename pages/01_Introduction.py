st.write("""
The PDB Analysis Platform is a comprehensive tool designed for researchers, scientists, and students 
working with protein structures. Our platform provides an intuitive interface to analyze and compare 
Protein Data Bank (PDB) files, helping you gain insights into protein structures and their properties.

## Key Features

### 1. PDB File Validation
Upload your PDB files and verify their integrity with our validation system. We check for standard 
format compliance and common structural issues.

### 2. Structural Analysis
Analyze key properties of protein structures:
- Residue and atom counts
- Chain identification
- Secondary structure elements
- Bond lengths and angles
- Structural motifs

### 3. Comparative Analysis
Compare two PDB files to identify:
- Structural differences
- Conformational changes
- Ligand binding effects
- Mutation impacts

### 4. Visualization
While we don't provide direct 3D visualization, our analysis results are designed to complement 
popular visualization tools like PyMOL.

## Getting Started

To begin using the platform:

1. Navigate to the **Tutorial** section to learn how to use the platform effectively
2. Go to the **Analysis** page to upload and analyze your PDB files
3. Use the **Contact** form if you need assistance or have suggestions

## Who Should Use This Platform?

- **Structural Biologists**: Analyze protein structures and compare different models
- **Computational Chemists**: Evaluate structural changes in proteins
- **Students**: Learn about protein structure and bioinformatics
- **Researchers**: Generate insights for publications and research projects

# Display example use cases
with st.expander("Example Use Cases"):
    st.write("""
    ### Use Case 1: Analyzing Protein Mutations
    Compare wild-type and mutant protein structures to understand how mutations affect protein folding and function.

    ### Use Case 2: Drug Discovery
    Analyze protein-ligand interactions by comparing bound and unbound protein structures to identify key binding sites.

    ### Use Case 3: Protein Engineering
    Evaluate structural changes in engineered proteins to optimize stability, activity, or specificity.

    ### Use Case 4: Education
    Use the platform as a teaching tool to help students understand protein structure principles and analysis techniques.
