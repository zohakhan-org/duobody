# Display example use cases
with st.expander("Example Use Cases"):
    st.write("""
    ### Use Case 1: Bi-specific Antibody Creation
    Create designs for bi-specific antibodies by analyzing the interactions between two different antibody structures and a common receptor. This helps in understanding how to optimize binding affinities and specificities.
    
    ### Use Case 2: Analyzing Protein Mutations
    Compare wild-type and mutant protein structures to understand how mutations affect protein folding and function.

    ### Use Case 3: Drug Discovery
    Analyze protein-ligand interactions by comparing bound and unbound protein structures to identify key binding sites.

    ### Use Case 4: Protein Engineering
    Evaluate structural changes in engineered proteins to optimize stability, activity, or specificity.

    ### Use Case 5: Education
    Use the platform as a teaching tool to help students understand protein structure principles and analysis techniques.
